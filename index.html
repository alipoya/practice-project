        <h1>Cartoons and Their Influence In Twenty First Century</h1>
        <p>Cartoons are essential part of every childhood. They are, certainly, the most popular entertainment for
            children,
            but also much more than that. With the help of cartoons kids can learn about the world around us, about new
            emotions, life issues and other important things.
            As a little girl, I enjoyed watching Disney animated movies based on fairy tales. I remember they took me to
            the
            world of imagination, where I was a princess, who was waiting for a prince charming to come and rescue me.
            My
            favourite fairy tale was “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs“. I will never forget how excited I have been
            while my
            brother and I prepared to go to the cinema with our parents, to watch this story in animated version, for
            the
            first time. Only later did VHS and videotapes come, enabling us to record and enjoy our favourite scenes and
            episodes. Snow White helped me in many ways.</p>
